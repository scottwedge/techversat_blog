Prototyping Using 3D Printer!
=============================

Couple of days ago, after more than 10 weeks of waiting, we finally got our first 3D printer:
`Solidoodle <http://www.solidoodle.com>`_. It was worth the wait. Our first test prints
had no issues, and we were pretty impressed with the quality of the prints.

We wanted something practical for our initial batch of prints. We have our first batch
of Acrylic case being shipped to us, but there was no way of validating whether the
cutouts will align properly with the LED matrix and the PCB.

It was as simple as converting the Google sketchup 3D model into .stl file and loading
it into Solidoodle's interface to get our 3D parts! How times have changed... amazing.

Here's the photo of the mounting piece getting printed:

And testing the fitment:

Finally, both mounting bracket install and a small bottom leg to keep it level.
It's nearly complete!
